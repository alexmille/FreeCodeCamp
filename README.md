# Free Code Camp Curriculum
https://learn.freecodecamp.org/

I've decided to complete the **Front End Libraries Certification** on [Free Code Camp](https://learn.freecodecamp.org). I'll save my answers in this repo as I go along.

## Program
The program covers 6 different topics:
1. Bootstrap
2. jQuery
3. Sass
4. [React](https://github.com/alexmille/FreeCodeCamp/tree/master/Front%20End%20Libraries%20Certification/4-React)
5. Redux
6. React & Redux

I'll start with React because I already did Bootstrap & jQuery a few months (or years?) ago.
## Projects
In order to get the certification, 5 different projects must be done:
Project | Status | Result
--------|--------|-------
Random Quote Machine | To do | -
Markdown Previewer | Done | [Link](https://codesandbox.io/s/84jmkx5ywj)
